\chapter{Other Elements}
\label{chp:other_elements}

This section shows you how to add other elements, like figures or tables, to your document.

Inline elements, except for source code, should always be centered.

Prefer floating environments to inline elements.
For floating environments, always provide a caption and a label plus reference them in text.

Even though the \texttt{hypcap} package is used to improve hyperlink targets, some floating environments still need manual tweaking.
Put \texttt{\textbackslash{}capstart} at the beginning of non-standard floating environments, like \texttt{algorithm} and \texttt{listing}.

\section{Tables}

Simple tables are no problem; however, crafting complex tables in \LaTeX{} can be quite time consuming.
Consider drawing more complex tables manually using TikZ.

\subsection{Simple Table}

Avoid using \texttt{\textbackslash{}hline} for tables as it messes up spacing.
Use \texttt{\textbackslash{}toprule}, \texttt{\textbackslash{}midrule}, and \texttt{\textbackslash{}bottomrule} instead.

Text should be left aligned, while numbers should be right aligned.

Avoid having tables side by side.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
	\toprule
	Description & Count & Price (single)\\
	\midrule
	Soda & 6 & 2.49 €\\
	Coffee & 2 & 3.19 €\\
	Sandwich & 1 & 5.39 €\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Wider Table}

Tables are condensed by default, consider using \texttt{tabularx} with some sensible width.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.75\textwidth}{Xrr}
	\toprule
	Description & Count & Price (single)\\
	\midrule
	Soda & 6 & 2.49 €\\
	Coffee & 2 & 3.19 €\\
	Sandwich & 1 & 5.39 €\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Floating Table}

\Cref{tbl:some_table} is floating.
It has a caption and is referenced at the beginning of this paragraph.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{0.75\textwidth}{Xrr}
		\toprule
		Description & Count & Price (single)\\
		\midrule
		Soda & 6 & 2.49 €\\
		Coffee & 2 & 3.19 €\\
		Sandwich & 1 & 5.39 €\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{This table has a caption.}
	\label{tbl:some_table}
\end{table}

\section{Graphics}

Graphical elements come in many different forms, most of them will be picture or diagrams.

\subsection{Figures}

Figures should never be put inline, use the \texttt{figure} environment and reference them, like it is done with \cref{fig:some_figure}.
Having a concise caption and explaining it by going over the figure's content in the running text is preferred.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/example.pdf}
	\caption{An example image.}
	\label{fig:some_figure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{TikZ}

TikZ can be used to draw beautiful, well-structured diagrams as shown in \cref{fig:tikz_figure}.
Like with everything else regarding \LaTeX, drawing complex diagrams can be quite time consuming.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{images/example.tikz}
	\caption{An example figure using TikZ.}
	\label{fig:tikz_figure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Plots}

\Cref{fig:some_plot} is been generated by a Python script using the \texttt{matplotlib} package.
The way it is included ensures the same font is used for axis labels and so on.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{images/plot.pgf}
	\caption{A plot created from a Python script.}
	\label{fig:some_plot}
\end{figure}

\section{Algorithms}

Some people prefer to use properly typeset algorithms, like \cref{alg:some_algorithm}, over simply using pseudo-code with a scripting language like syntax.
Pick your poison.

\begin{algorithm}
	\capstart
	\KwResult{Write here the result }
	\BlankLine
	initialization\;
	\While{condition}{
		instructions\tcp*{side comment}
		\tcp{comment}
		\eIf{condition}{
			instructions1\;
			instructions2\;
		}{
			instructions3\;
		}
	}
	\caption{An example algorithm.}
	\label{alg:some_algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Source Code}

As computer scientists, showing source code is as common as showing mathematical expressions.
This section elaborates the recommended options for typesetting source code.

\subsection{Inline Code}

If you need to have code inline, rather than floating, consider wrapping it with \texttt{minipage} so it is not split across pages.

\begin{minipage}{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
	puts("Hello World\n");
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{External File}

Consider putting source code into external files and including them using the appropriate command.

\begin{minipage}{0.95\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[language=c]{code/sample.c}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Listing}

See \cref{lst:some_listing}.

\lstinputlisting[language=c,float,caption={Some source code.},label={lst:some_listing}]{code/sample.c}

\subsection{Minted}

Minted is an external, Python based tool that provides syntax highlighting for various different languages.
See \cref{lst:minted_example} for an example.
Consider using it instead of the regular \texttt{listings} package.
Mixing them is not recommended as they do not look exactly the same.
Code can be written inline and taken from external files.

If you encounter issues with Minted, just remove the corresponding lines from the preamble.

\begin{listing}
	\capstart
	\inputminted{haskell}{code/sample.hs}
	\caption{Example source code, using the \texttt{minted} package.}
	\label{lst:minted_example}
\end{listing}
