\chapter*{Abstract}

This document serves as a template and a guide on how to use it --- both in one.
While \LaTeX{} can do pretty much anything in theory, the further away you stray from the defaults, the more likely you'll get stabbed in the back by package incompatibilities.
The most important packages are already included and should work fine for you out of the box.
Further hints are provided along the way.

It goes without saying that this document serves as testing infrastructure for itself.

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code\footnote{\url{https://code.visualstudio.com/}} with the \emph{LaTeX Workshop}\footnote{\url{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop}} extension.
