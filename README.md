# DPS LaTeX Template

This repository holds the official DPS LaTeX template for theses.
It is recommended to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension.

Since [Minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted) is used for source code highlighting, the `python3-pygments` package needs to be installed in order to build the template.
However, Minted can also be removed with little effort.

Build and read the template for further information.
